\chapter{Abstract}
Healthcare suffers from many manual processes such as correlating measurements, suggesting diagnosis, going through the patient's personal/family history, looking for past similar cases ... \\
Therefore, we propose an approach to empower physicians and speed-up diagnostic making for patients admitted in Intensive Care Units. This approach shows significant improvement over a single-admission scenario, as we leverage Graph-based ML techniques to convey relational information from previous admissions of other patients. \\
Therefore, we show how the combination of graphs and advanced ML techniques helps pushing fostering automation in healthcare.
